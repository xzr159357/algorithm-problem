​															**1004 Counting Leaves (30 分)**

A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree. Your job is to count those family members who have no child.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0<*N*<100, the number of nodes in a tree, and *M* (<*N*), the number of non-leaf nodes. Then *M* lines follow, each in the format:

```
ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
```

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, `K` is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be `01`.

The input ends with *N* being 0. That case must NOT be processed.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child **for every seniority level** starting from the root. The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of each line.

The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where `01` is the root and `02` is its only child. Hence on the root `01` level, there is `0` leaf node; and on the next level, there is `1` leaf node. Then we should output `0 1` in a line.

### Sample Input:

```in
2 1
01 1 02
```

### Sample Output:

```out
0 1
```

# 二、代码

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <string.h>

vector<int> arr[100];
int book[100], maxdepth = -1;
void DFs(int index, int depth)
{
    if (arr[index].size() == 0)//叶子节点
    {
        book[depth]++;
        maxdepth = max(maxdepth, depth);
        return;
    }


    for (int i = 0; i < arr[index].size(); i++)
    {
        DFs(arr[index][i], depth + 1);
    }
}

int main()
{
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    {
        int node, k;
        cin >> node >> k;
        for (int j = 0; j < k; j++)
        {
            int temp;
            cin >> temp;
            arr[node].push_back(temp);
        }
    }

    DFs(1, 0);//从根节点开始递归，depth为0，第一层

    cout << book[0];
    for (int i = 1; i <= maxdepth; i++)
    {
        cout << " " << book[i];
    }


    return 0;
    
}
```



# 三、思路

该题求树每层中叶子节点的数目。首先，利用二维数组记录对应节点的子节点各元素，然后DFS整棵树，寻找每个子节点中的叶子节点个数，并对应层的个数加一。
